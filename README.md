### Dependencies used in this project are
- Prettier for formatting
- Lint to flag programming errors
- Express to build and start the server
- Sharp to process the image to the required width and height
- Jasmine to write test cases for the code

run `npm install` in the root folder to download all the required dependencies to start the application

## API References

# End Points
these are the end points you can access by writing the end point after the localhost address ,for example `http://127.0.0.1:5000/images`

- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/images/api?filename={your name file name.jpg}&width={width}&height={height}` to generate the image in the desired width and height , stored in the resized folder inside /images folder
- you can't enter invalid file name , will generate code 400 bad request, or entering invalid parameters either only width or only height without each other also will generate the 400 status code.
